When you are inside typescript project you probably dont want typescript error when using the component.

So, you can extend the types of the component by modifing your tsconfig.json file.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["bsky-profile"]
  }
}
```

For it to work you have to install `bsky-profile` as dependency in your package.json.
