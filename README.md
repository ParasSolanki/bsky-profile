# Bsky Profile

Unofficial BSKY ([Bluesky](https://bsky.app)) Profile Webcomponent

Bsky Profile Webcomponent. `<bsky-profile>` is a custom web component that displays a user's Bluesky profile. It fetches the profile data from the Bluesky API and renders it in a clean, responsive layout and with dark, light and auto theme support.

Additionally, the component respects the user's device settings and avoids animations if the user has enabled "Reduce Motion" in their browser preferences.
